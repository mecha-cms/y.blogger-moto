This is not a clone of the original Moto template. I didnâ€™t make it from the original source code, but by refactoring
it using more modern CSS and HTML syntax.

### Features

Other color variants of this template have been combined into one. You can enable other color variants via
`.\lot\y\blogger-moto\state.php` file:

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'skin' => ['name' => 'mr']
];
~~~

The default color variant is `mr`. There are several other color variants you can try, including `ms`, and `so`. These
are the official color variants provided by the designer of this template in the past.
